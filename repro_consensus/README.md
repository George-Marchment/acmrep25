# Reproducibility Consensus

>After implementing and running the workflow described [here](https://george-marchment.github.io/acmrep25/). Please send the results of the workflow (the `tsv` as well as the `csv` file) to `george.marchment[at]universite-paris-saclay.fr`.

The goal of the reproducibility consensus is to determine at what level the results obtained from the participants are reproducible. To accomplish, the consensus workflow has been developed to compare the results of the participants. The workflow's source code is presented here.
